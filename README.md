# Primchess
First major project in Javascript &amp; jQuery - will soon be able to play chess against a bot in browser. Highlight will be the algorithms I hope to implement to make it the best chess player it can be - hoping to use Minimax algorithms, book moves &amp; hardcoded logic to determine optimal scores in move decisions. More information to come.

# Credit
A major credit goes to Bluefever Software who created a tutorial on creating a playable chess GUI in Javascript along with some algorithms. The code is not a mirror image of his, but the method of implementation is nearly synonymous, and I used it to familiarize myself with Javascript, and pick up new programming practices. You can see his tutorial here: https://youtu.be/2eA0bD3wV3Q

# Current Utilization
Not capable of almost anything yet, but if you would like to try it yourself, run this on a local server and open up the console. Paste in a FEN number into the prompt box, and the board will load into the correct configuration - uppercase letters for white's pieces, and lowercase for black's pieces. Use `comp();` in the console to have it compute a move for the current side to move. It will not make an intelligent decision yet, just "a" decision, as this project is in prototype stages (if the lack of a GUI wasn't an indicator).
